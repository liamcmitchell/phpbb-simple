Simple
=======

Simple phpBB3 theme using the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework. The intention was to completely rewrite the base theme to be as clean and generic as possible. All original CSS and images have been removed. The only images are [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/) that come with Bootstrap.

This is a work in progress. Because so much of the original HTML has been modified, some functionality may be broken.

[proBoot](http://shibulijack.github.io/proBoot/) was used as a base to start with.

Theme used at [Akita JET Board](http://akitajet.com/phpbb/index.php)

**phpBB version:** phpBB 3.0.11
